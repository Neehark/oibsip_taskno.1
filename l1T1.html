      <b>You will be surprised to know that</b>Cats meow for their humans, not other cats. Domesticated cats have evolved alongside humans long enough to know that certain sounds and tones will get us to do as they please. Cats will communicate with different meows to get us to feed them, comfort them, and even adopt themCats can jump up to 6 times their height. They are incredibly agile and can leap to impressive heights. This ability comes from their powerful leg muscles and flexible bodies. Cats have a specialized organ called the Jacobson's organ, located in the roof of their mouth. This organ allows them to analyze scents in a unique way. When a cat opens its mouth slightly and curls its upper lip, it is called the Flehmen response, and it helps them gather more information about the scent Cats have a third eyelid called the haw. This translucent membrane helps protect their eyes from dust and debris. It also helps moisten and lubricate the eyes Cats have a specialized collarbone called the clavicle, or collarbone. Unlike humans, cats' collarbones are not connected to their shoulder blades, which allows them to squeeze through tight spaces<br>
      Cats have a highly developed sense of hearing. They can hear frequencies as high as 64,000 Hz, which is much higher than what humans can hear. This acute hearing helps them detect prey and communicate with other cats.
Cats have a unique grooming behavior called allogrooming. This is when cats groom each other as a form of social bonding. It helps strengthen their social relationships and maintain cleanliness .Cats have a specialized tongue covered in tiny, backward-facing barbs called papillae. These barbs help them groom themselves efficiently by removing dirt and loose fur from their coats. The barbs also aid in the consumption of food, as they help cats scrape meat off bones.
Cats have a highly sensitive sense of touch. They have sensory whiskers on their face, paws, and even the backs of their legs. These whiskers help them navigate in the dark, detect changes in their environment, and determine if they can fit through a small space.
Cats have a unique way of marking their territory. They have scent glands located on their cheeks, paws, and tail. When a cat rubs against objects or people, they are leaving their scent as a way of marking their territory and signaling familiarity.
These strange and intriguing facts about cats showcase their unique characteristics and behaviors. Cats are truly fascinating.

          <p1><b><i>PERSIAN </i></b>
           <br> <b>PERSIAN CATS WERE IN THE WORLD’s FIRST CAT SHOW</b></br>
            They were showcased in the world’s first organized cat show in 1871 at the Crystal Palace in London. A whopping 20,000 people flocked to the show to witness a Persian kitten win the “Best in Show” award.
      <br><b> PERSIAN CATS HAVEN’T ALWAYS HAD FLAT FACES</b></br>
        Persian cats haven’t always had that distinctive flat face, but in the 1950s, a genetic mutation caused a batch of kittens to be born with those scrunched features. Breeders took to the new look and used selective breeding to get that Persian show cat “peke-faced” look. </p1></div>

        <p1><b><i>SIAMESE</i></b>
        <br><b>SIAMESE ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST CAT BREEDS.</b></br>
        The country of Thailand was known as Siam until the 1940s, and this is where these beautiful ancient cats derive their name. In fact, throughout the 1800s, they were the favored pets of the country’s royalty and were considered symbols of status and wealth.
      <br><b>THEY WERE ONCE REJECTED BY WESTERN SOCIETY.</b></br>
      Despite their ancient and current status as one of the most beautiful cat breeds on Earth, Siamese cats were once considered “ugly” by western society. The breed made its debut in London at an 1871 cat show where one journalist described them as “an unnatural, nightmare kind of cat.” Luckily, the stigma didn’t last, and they soon gained popularity in England and the UK. The first UK cat fanciers club devoted to the breed was established in 1902, and the breed was officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1906.
    <br><b>THEY COME IN UP TO 33 COLOR VARIATIONS.</b></br>
    Siamese cats typically develop one of four main color patterns: seal point, chocolate point, blue point, or lilac point. However, according to some sources, their coats come in up to 33 different color variations including caramel point and cinnamon point.</p1></div>

      Anne Baker from Riverside, California developed the Ragdolls in the 1960s. She trademarked the name Ragdoll and set up her own registry called The International Ragdoll Cat Association (IRCA) which enforced stringent standards on anyone who wanted to breed or sell cats under that name.

    Maine coons can croon! These cats communicate with a peculiar chirping sound, very unlike the familiar feline meow.
  <br><b>MAINE COON IN HARRY POTTER</b></br>
  Look out Hollywood—there’s a new star in town!
 You might recall a shaggy cat roaming the halls of Hogwarts in the beloved Harry Potter films. That’s Mrs. Norris—the Maine coon companion to the castle’s caretaker, Argus Filch.</p1>

    This breed is highly intelligent. They can be successfully clicker-trained to perform tricks, and they can even walk on a leash. Owners of Abyssinians have even been able to train them to run in agility courses.
    <br><b>“CLOWN OF THE CAT KINGDOM”</b></br>
    The Abyssinian can be a major jokester, who’ll try to impress you with his acrobatic antics. They can be found perching on your shoulder, leaping to great heights, and scaling your tallest bookshelves.

          <p1><b><i>EXOTIC SHORTHAIR</i></b>
          <br><b>ROUND,ALL ROUND</b></br>
          It is often said that the word 'round' is key when describing the Exotic Shorthair. Their head is round, their ears are round, their eyes are round, and so is their muzzle. They have beautifully round paws and an all-around, rounded body.</p1>

        <p1><b><i>LYKOI</i></b>
        <br><b>SHOULD STAY INDOOR</b></br>
        Lykois have no undercoat and are barely covered with a standard coat, therefore, they must be considered strictly indoor cats. Neither cold- nor particularly warm weather will suit this cat.
      <br><b>NOT EASILY AVAILABLE</b></br>
      An extremely rare breed still, there are fewer than 100 show-standard Lykoi in the world.</p1>

        <p1><b><i>BOMBAY </i></b>
        <br><b>AREN'T FROM BOMBAY</b></br>
        The origins of this breed are credited to American breeder, Nikki Horner, who wanted to develop a domestic breed that resembled a black leopard.  Ms. Horner began this project in the 1950s, and the first successful hybrid kitten was born in 1965. Horner named the breed “Bombay” because it resembled the black leopards of that exotic port town in India.
      <br><b>RAREEEE</b></br>
      The Bombay reached CFA championship status in 1976, but remains rare, Joan says, because the breed standard and temperament “is almost identical to the Burmese itself except for slightly longer body and leg length and jet black coat."</p1>

        <p1><b><i>BENGAL</i></b>
        <br><b>MEOW DIFFERENTLY</b></br>
        Bengal cats don’t have your typical meow. They make a raspy noise that can sound more like a bark.
      <br><b>BLUE BENGAL</b></br>
      The blue Bengal cat is the rarest and most unusual coloring for the Bengal cat. If you ever come across a blue Bengal, no one will judge you for taking as many pictures as possible. The blue Bengal will have a steel-blue or powdery-blue base coat with cream tones.

        <p1><b><i>HIMALAYAN</i></b>
        <br><b>JUST LIKE A LIVING TOY</b></br>
        At just 2.75 inches tall and 7.5 inches long, the world’s smallest cat was a Himalayan named Tinkertoy.
      <br><b>CROSSBRED</b></br>
      Himalayan cats owe their origins to responsible breeders who carefully crossbred two popular breeds: Persians to Siamese to create a new hybrid breed with Siamese point coloring and a Persian's long hair.
    <br><b>LOVE TALKING</b></br>
    They are loyal and affectionate cats who require lots of attention and love but tend to play favourites among their owners. They are very social, sweet and intelligent, and have been known to be quite talkative.  
       <br><b>MELANISTIC</b></br> 
       The colors of the background and the pattern are the same on a melanistic Bengal. Their patterns are called “ghost markings” or “ghost spots” because they are barely visible. But you can still see the pattern in daylight like you would on a black panther.</p1></div>

   <div class="text">
    <p1><b><i>SPHYNX</i></b>
      <br><b>HYPOELLERGIC</b></br>
    The fact is that no cat is hypoallergenic, but people with cat allergies are usually able to tolerate Sphynx. The irritation is usually caused by pet dander, and saliva spreads through the body when cleansing.Cats that do not have hair produce both saliva and dander, but without fur to shed, the risks of allergenic contact with humans are smaller.
    <br><b>A SUNBURN BUDDY</b></br>
  It doesn’t mean that you should start slathering sunscreen on your feline pal when it sits in the sunbeam. But, keep in mind that due to its lack of a dense coat, their skin is more sensitive than other cats. So they can get a sunburn.And if you take them out on a blazing summer afternoon, they can easily get overheated. Even though they can go outside in mild weather, they should be kept as indoor cats.
  <br><b>RICHIE RICH</b></br>
  They need a lot of attention. Unlike regular cats, Sphynx cats are ravenous because of their high metabolism and desire for food.They need a very high protein diet for optimal health. To keep them healthy and well-stuffed, you need to keep a bigger budget for  high-quality cat food.</p1>

        <br><b>HEAVY WEIGHT CHAMPIONS</b></br>
        When it comes to weight, these cats pack a punch. Burmese cats may look sleek and petite, but their size is misleading. They have a compact and muscular build, making them heavier than they appear.This trait has led them to be described as “bricks wrapped in silk.”</p1>

    <p1><b><i>SIBERIAN</i></b>
    <br><b>COLDEST OF ALL</b></br>
    The Siberian cat is known to be the most cold-resistant domestic cat thanks to their thick and long coats. Their coats are also water-repellent. A Pedigreed Award-Winning Siberian cat played the role of Mr Fuzzypants in 2016's Nive Lives movie starring Kevin Spacey.
    <br><b>THICK LAYER COAT</b></br>
    From tufted ears to exquisite neck ruff to their big, bushy tail, the most remarkable attribute of a Siberian is their thick, three-layered coat. It consists of coarse and straight guard hairs, thin and wavy awn hairs, and a wooly down undercoat.

    <p1><b><i>LAPREM</i></b>
    <br><b>LAPERMS CAN BE BORN BALD, OR WITH STRAIGHT OR CURLY FUR.</b></br>
    LaPerm cats are occasionally born bald, but the kittens may also sometimes be covered in wavy or straight fur. Around 2 weeks of age, they’ll often start losing their coats, starting with a patch on top of their heads. They’ll remain bald for a while, until they eventually sprout a new coat that mimics the original texture.</p1>

    The soft and curly coat on the Devon Rex is also unusual. Many Devons have a lack of fur on some areas, especially those areas where she can lick herself. The coat is fragile and even grooming can cause the fur to break off completely. Devons also generally have broken whiskers because the whiskers are also fragile.</p1>
